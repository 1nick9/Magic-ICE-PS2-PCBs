quick alt did that should suit 3225 crystal seeing the resonator used went eol 2023. both untested. haven't even checked datasheet to confirm setup, idea purely done off the duo2 design where could be cermic or crystal and suggestion 3225 should suit.

Edit: need active 3225 for how cadded. link was passive which just crystal across 1 2. below is active 3225 50mhz should work leaving off 33k on osc1/osc2
